If  you're finding yourself irritated by Google's AI generated summaries and you can't use a browser extension to get rid of them, you might want to try this simple bookmarklet. 

A bookmarklet is a bookmark enhanced with JavaScript. Copy the bookmarklet code and save it as a bookmark in your browser, ideally in the bookmarks bar where it'll be handy. 

To use it, simply click on it as you would any bookmark. The bookmarklet will prompt you for your Google query, append -nobodyaskedyou to it, and open a Google results page with the modified query. Every time I tested this it got
rid of the AI summary, probably because "-nobodyaskedyou" is a bit of query bolus undigestible by the AI.
